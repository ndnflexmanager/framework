This file describes an API for pull and push message exchanges used for Management in CCN. Also we will find a brief description of the API classes.

ManagamentAgent.java and ManagementEntity.java are the classes that contain the 
necessary methods to express pull and push requests.

MA.java and ME.java are the interfaces to create the application which will use this API.

MyInterestListener.java is a class that we will use to capture interests in push requests.
 
We have included two example applications to show how it works.
